      <h1>Our Product </h1>
      <p> Banglet </p>
    </div>
      Banglet is a smart bracelet product that offers venues access to VIP attendee locations to 
      enable services such as concierge (food and drink delivery). When it comes to end-users, the 
      bracelet could enable touch payments, seamless identity check for access to VIP-restricted areas 
      and ordering drinks, as well as potentially an option to find points and persons of interest 
      (bathrooms, medical team, other bracelet users).
    <p  class='head'>For Whom</p>
      <div> <ul> 
        <li> Event venues offering VIP option</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    <p  class='head'>What It Does</p>
      <div> 
        Collects data such as:
        <ul>
        <li> Guests' location</li>
        <li> Check-ins at Vendors</li>
        <li> Amount of money spent on which vendors</li>
       </ul>
        From the data, our system analyzes and models the data collected and present it to the event planner 
        to help the planner enhance the VIP experience they provide to guests. 
    <p  class='head'>How It Works</p>
      <div> 
        Using UWB (Ultra-Wideband, used for short range communication) as our communication technology to 
        connect the bracelets to our servers, each individual 
        bracelet will carry the user/guest info and the bracelet will send location and purchase info to our 
        server for analysis. At the same time, the bracelet can be used as identification and payment tool 
        where the user can upload their info in advance to their banglet account and have their info available 
        on the QR code on their Banglet. 
      </div>
    <p  class='head'>Key Benefits</p>
      <div> <ul>
        <li> For users, our product provides ease of identification (ticket, ID, payment). </li>
        <li> For venues, it provides location of guests to improve vendor localization. </li>
      </ul>
