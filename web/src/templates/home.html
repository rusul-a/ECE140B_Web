      <h1>ECE 140B Team Website </h1>
      <p> By Rusul Al Busultan </p>
    </div>
   <p class="p2"> We are three undergrad Electrical Engineering students and one graduate ME-EE student. 
     Our team focuses on developing an IoT device that uses Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. </p>
     <p class="p2">Visit out Product and KVP pages:</p>
      <p class="p2"> <button type="button" class="but"> <a href="/product" target="blank"> Product Page </a></button>
      <button type="button" class="but"> <a href="/kvp" target="blank"> KVP Page </a></button> </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Improvement #1: Visibility</h3>
          <p> Placed the links of the product and KVP pages in Buttons as shown above. I placed it in 
            the middle and matched button color with the web theme color for more Visibility and Consistency.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column" >
          <h3>Improvement #2: Consistency</h3>
          <p> The pattern of the webpage design as well as the text layout is consistent to keep the page
            easy to read and follow. Choosing one theme color keeps the web color consistent as well.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Improvement #3: Hard Cognitive tasks</h3>
          <p> I used simple works and notations to make it easy for the webpage visiter to follow what 
            our project is, what it does, and how it does it.

      <p class='head'> Product Ideas </p>
      
      <p> Our Current Product Idea: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b> Activity Tracking Bracelet (Banglet): </b> </a> 
          Banglet is a smart bracelet product that offers venues access to VIP attendee locations to 
          enable services such as concierge (food and drink delivery). When it comes to end-users, the 
          bracelet could enable touch payments, seamless identity check for access to VIP-restricted areas 
          and ordering drinks, as well as potentially an option to find points and persons of interest 
          (bathrooms, medical team, other bracelet users).
       </li>
      </ul>
